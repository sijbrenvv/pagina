In collaboration with Dagblad van het Noorden, 8D Games, and AI Hub North, this research will develop AI tools to improve Dutch news accessibility and readability for those who struggle with traditional news formats, specifically for low-literate demographics, through simplifying, summarising, and altering the perspective and frame of a given text. Additionally, these tools will help journalists to better understand readersâ€™ experiences.\nThe project aims to equip journalists with technology, integrating it into their creative process and establishing a framework that other news organisations can adopt. Field testing will involve low-literate citizens to ensure the tools are effective in meeting their needs and promoting more inclusive news consumption.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/pagina/","section":"Promoting the Application of Generative AI for Improved News Accessibility","summary":"","title":"Promoting the Application of Generative AI for Improved News Accessibility"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/pagina/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
