Bringing journalism closer to the public using AI-driven applications
{{< /lead >}}

The PAGINA project is a [ClickNL PPP grant](https://www.clicknl.nl/en/pps/)-funded project led by the [Computational Linguistics group](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl/) of the University of Groningen aimed at bridging the gap between journalism and citizens.
In collaboration with [Dagblad van het Noorden](https://dvhn.nl/), [8D Games](https://8d-games.nl/), and [AI Hub North](https://www.aihub-noord.nl/en/), this research will develop AI tools to improve Dutch news accessibility and readability for those who struggle with traditional news formats, specifically for low-literate demographics, through simplifying, summarising, and altering the perspective and frame of a given text. Additionally, these tools will help journalists to better understand readersâ€™ experiences.

The project aims to equip journalists with technology, integrating it into their creative process and establishing a framework that other news organisations can adopt. Field testing will involve low-literate citizens to ensure the tools are effective in meeting their needs and promoting more inclusive news consumption.
