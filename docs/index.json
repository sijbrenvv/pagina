We are grateful for the valuable feedback after the presentation and insightful conversations during the poster session and reception. We thank the organisers for this warm conference.\nFeel free to reach out to us if you have questions or want to chat!\nOur presentation can be downloaded as a pdf here.\n","date":"12 September 2025","permalink":"/pagina/events/clin20250912/","section":"All the events the PAGINA team participates in","summary":"","title":"CLIN35"},{"content":" Bringing journalism closer to the public using AI-driven applications The PAGINA project aims to bridge the gap between journalism and citizens.

For example by the two approaches below. Higher readability entails that a text is easier or quicker to read, due to lower processing loads.\nText Simplification\rExploring the use of automatic text simplification to reduce the complexity of a text, so it becomes more comprehensible to the wider public.\nPerspective Detection and Alteration\rExploring the detection of the perspective or frame of a text to change it in such a way that the general public or a specific target group feels seen, heard, and more included.\nAbout Us\rThe PAGINA project is driven by the Computational Linguistics research group at the University of Groningen, in which we collaborate with a regional newspaper, a design company, and an AI application institution.\rLearn More\rCollaborate with Us\rWe are always open to new collaborations and ideas.\nGet in Touch\r","date":null,"permalink":"/pagina/","section":"Promoting the Application of Generative AI for Improved News Accessibility","summary":"","title":"Promoting the Application of Generative AI for Improved News Accessibility"},{"content":"The PAGINA team has presented their ongoing work at TABU Dag 2025.\nTABU Dag is a well-established, international linguistics conference organised at the University of Groningen with a varied programme and guest speakers from different fields.\nIn our presentation, we stressed the importance of text simplification and its challenges, especially regarding evaluation, advocating the need for human-centered evaluation where the readers are put first.\nWe described our dataset with aggregated reading times from thousands of actual readers and how it can be used to train a reading time predictor. Such a predictor could be useful for evaluating simplified texts, where lower predicted reading time implies a text is easier to read, assuming that people read faster through simple(r) texts.\nNext to the predictor, we asked three large language models (LLM) to directly assess the reading time and complexity of several articles from the dataset.\nWe find good features at different linguistic levels that are informative to predict reading time and that LLMs can look into more subtle features such as style, tone, comprehension, and cognitive load.\n","date":"12 June 2025","permalink":"/pagina/events/tabu20250612/","section":"All the events the PAGINA team participates in","summary":"","title":"TABU Dag 2025"},{"content":"\rWhen: Tuesday 29-04-2025 12:30 - 17:00 Where: House of Connections, Grote Markt 21, Groningen\nThe PAGINA team invites you to an event where PhD student within the Graduate school of the Humanities present their project and work.\nAre you interested in what we have done so far and what we will work on next?
